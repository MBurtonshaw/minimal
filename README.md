# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made to figure out how to toggle a site between light and dark mode; I used react and bootstrap to do it.
The intention was to have a vey sleek, minimalist site w smooth animations, peaceful images, and lorem ipsum text.
